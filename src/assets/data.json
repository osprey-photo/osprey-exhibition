Taylor","description":"My aim was to capture the London ‘urban’ scape of concrete, steel and glass by giving it my own twist. My panel consists of photos of the modern structures of the city through their reflections in the glass of other buildings. I was attracted by the colours, shapes and patterns the reflections created, but also by the distortions - giving the architecture an abstract and artistic impression. Some of the images are composite images created in camera to add a touch confusion and mystery.

Just by sitting and watching I am always amazed at 'what turns up'. With lovely light on most days I was able to capture these creatures going about their business and enjoy the process of photographing nature on my doorstep. I even had the privilege of feeding a young Robin for several weeks from my hand which provided much pleasure through a difficult time","thumbnail":"gallery/soQ2Z7q5LvD_tb.png","options":{"width":3},"large":"gallery/soQ2Z7q5LvD_large.png"},"Gabor Kovacs":{"title":"Reflections – Canary Wharf","author":"Gabor Kovacs","description":"In September 2019 I went to London, on an expedition to photograph Canary Wharf. I took many photographs of the buildings, of geometrical patterns in concrete, steel and glass. Amongst the images I took that day where a couple of dozen where I had been looking down, not up. This series of images captures reflections of skyscrapers in the water of the various docks, the play of light reflected from the buildings and then the water.","thumbnail":"gallery/zcijnpOyZBn_tb.png","options":{"width":5},"large":"gallery/zcijnpOyZBn_large.png"},"Helen Otton":{"title":"Impressionist Landscape","author":"Helen Otton","description":"","thumbnail":"gallery/iPpBamSgYuU_tb.png","options":{"width":3},"large":"gallery/iPpBamSgYuU_large.png"}}}
